# Tech Internship Resources

This is a list of resources that I have compiled through my own software engineering internship search.  This is by no means a comprehensive list nor am I affiliated with any of the organizations or writers listed below.

Please feel free to contribute to this resource list.  To do so, either:
* Create an [Issue](https://github.com/mitalipalekar/tech-internship-resources/issues)
* Put in a [Merge Request](https://github.com/mitalipalekar/tech-internship-resources/pulls) (preferred)
* Send me an email at <mitali97@cs.washington.edu>

**Note: While there may be an overlap with other tech internships like data science etc., this list is primarily focused on software engineering internships.**

## Resume Resources
* *[How to Write Your First Resume](resume_uwcse.doc)*: Advice by the University of Washington Paul G. Allen School of Computing on best practices to attract industry recruiters
* [Resume Tips](http://courses.washington.edu/envh482/Resumes.pdf): Presentation put together by the University of Washington's Career & Internship Center on best resume practices
* [HH Websites & Resumes](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1487708811477672/): Great community for both peer reviewing of resumes (getting feedback on your own resume) as well as seeing sample resumes of other individuals within the tech industry

## Getting that Experience
* [Karan Goel's Mega Project List](https://github.com/karan/Projects): Great *starting point* for students looking to gain exposure to interview like questions as well as translate their classroom knowledge into real computer science problems
* [Angel List](https://angel.co/): Start-ups are a great way to gain some footing in the tech industry as well as make a large impact within a smaller setting.

## *How to get an Interview* Resources
* [Apply.fyi](https://www.apply.fyi): An updated list of Software Engineering Internships with useful information about each company (like salaries, categories, and descriptions)
* [Intern Supply](http://www.intern.supply/): Interview Preparation Resources as well as an up-to-date list of tech companies and their job postings - make sure to sign up for their newsletter too!
* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/): Lots of job postings here as well as a great place to start cold calling recruiters
* **Career Fairs**: Don't just hand your resume out, **make sure to get recruiters' contact info** so that you can follow up with them after the career fair as well as next year
* [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/): For Job Postings!
* **Referrals**: Ask people you know who work at companies you are interested in to refer you! They don't have to be friends and you can leverage your school's alumni network to get a referral.

Hopefully by now, you have your own spreadsheet of different companies that you are thinking about applying to as well as their recruiter's name and contact info :)
